# Technologies Used
## Data Cleaning and Analysis
`Pandas` will be used to clean the data and perform an exploratory analysis. Further analysis will be completed using Python.

## Database Storage
`pgAdmin` is the database we intend to use.

## Machine Learning
`SciKitLearn` is the ML library we'll be using to create a classifier. We prepare to use Multiple Linear Regression as our model.

## Dashboard
We will be using `Tableau` to prepare and show our dashboard.
